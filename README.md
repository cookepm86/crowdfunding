# crowdfunding

The notebook defines two functions with which to obtain the trending market segments in crowdfunding data. Both functions take the data, the start and end dates, a smoothing parameter and the number of top trending segments to view, as arguments. The functions can be found in the 'The trending functions:' section of the notebook.

An appendix is also included, with some preliminary work on applying clustering techniques to the data.
